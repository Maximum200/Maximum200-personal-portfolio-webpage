                            I picked up this book (image below) at the library that taught me the basics of Scratch, a high-level programming language created by MIT.<br>
                            I'll include a few of my old scratch projects over at the "My Projects" section just to see how I've progressed over the years.<br>

                            I think this book was the reason I could really get into programming as it taught me how to make simple games in an engaging manner.<br>
                            I would definitely recommend this book to those who would like to get started on learning programming.<br>

                            Around this period I finished with my Scratch learning <s>only took me 2 years</s> and started moving on to Python.<br>
                            It was somewhat of a significant leap from Scratch to Python as coding went from drag and drop to a text-based interface<br>
                            + Python complexity was higher so it became harder to learn<br>
                            Same as before I'll include some of my old Python projects over at the "My Projects" Section.<br>
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            Honestly I think I forgot about programming for a while.<br>
                            At least I learnt how to use more "fun" modules like Turtle and Tinkter.<br>

                            ... So after a longer break, I decided to learn HTML and CSS because I was kinda bored.<br>
                            Why I went for them instead of Javascript or C++ I have no idea.<br>
                            It was actually quite fun though, I learnt how to make <em>very</em> simple websites and how to style them with CSS<br>
                            Same as before I'll include some of my CSS "<s>Artworks</s> Works" over at the "My Projects" Section.<br>
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            Yet another timeskip.. Forgot about programming for a <sub><s>longer</s></sub> while.<br>
                            For some reason I went for HTML and CSS instead of continuing with Python. <br>
                            No complains though<!-- /s-->, it was somewhat of a nice change of pace learning how to make websites instead of apps.<br>
                            The website I used to learn HTML and CSS was <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp</a>.<br>
                            It's a really good website to learn about programming in general and I would recommend it to beginners.<br>

                            On this specfic day I got my <b>Responsive Web Design </b>certificate from freeCodeCamp (image below).<br>
                            It took me a long while but I eventually got it (and learnt a lot along the way).<br>
                            A few days later I managed to get into my desired subject combination and am <em>for now</em> learning H2 Computing for the A levels.<br>
                            Its been a long way from my Scratch coding days and I am proud of how far I've gone over the years. <br>

                            So yeah I think I really improved a lot since 2016.<br>
                            I know a lot more about programmng in general now and hope to learn more during H2 Computing.<br>
                            There's still a lot more languages that I have yet to learn like Java and C++ so I hope to eventually get to those.<br>
